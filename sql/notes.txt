17.16666666666667  // store this value  this is the hashed password

how a VERY BASIC recipe for cryptography works

goal is to make my hash function a one-way function
easy to make a hash, but very hard to go the other way

salt is an extra random string that goes before the password hash   a;lksfjeeoirfdsf
token is a secret that goes after the password hash lksaadifie

salt.pwdhash.token

a;lksfjeeoirfdsf.  5495f0c302b232ac6012e28f31e07984fbd411c641298bc718a9ac57403c1fb3    .lksaadifie

chances of collision to be as close to zero as possible
